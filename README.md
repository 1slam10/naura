# Neura - Golang Machine Learning Library (Under Development)

**Neura** is an open-source, zero-dependency machine learning library written in Go. The goal of Neura is to provide a fast, efficient, and minimalistic solution for machine learning tasks, tailored to the simplicity and performance focus of Go.

## Project Status: ðŸš§ Under Development ðŸš§

Neura is currently in its early stages. The core functionality is being developed, and contributions, feedback, and suggestions are highly encouraged. 

**Note:** 
> This library is not ready for production (or any other, lol) use yet.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Zero Dependencies:** Neura is designed with no external dependencies, keeping the library lightweight and fast.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Support for common machine learning algorithms, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Decision Trees
- **Performance-Focused:** Built with Goâ€™s performance strengths in mind, ensuring minimal overhead.
- **Developer-Friendly API:** A simple, intuitive interface designed for Go developers.
- **Extensible Design:** The library is structured to allow easy expansion with additional models and tools.

## Info

### Installation

```bash
# Coming soon
```

### Usage

```go
// Example usage of Neura will be added here soon.
```

### Roadmap

- Basic Linear Algebra Operations
- Data Preprocessing Utilities
- Regression Models (e.g., Linear, Logistic)
- Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)
- Model Evaluation Metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision)
- Neural Networks (Future Plans)

### Contributing

All contributors are welcomed! Whether you're new to Go or a seasoned developer, feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request. Contribution guidelines will be provided soon.
